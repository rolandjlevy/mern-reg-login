## Registration & login with MERN stack

The aim of this project is to make an application using the MERN stack which allows a user to register, login and view details

## Setup ⚙️

- Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/rolandjlevy/registration-and-login-with-MERN.git`
- Install dependencies by running `npm install`
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the environment variables (I will provide these in an email)
- For the React UI and back end, run `npm run dev` and go to `http://localhost:3000`
- For the back end only, run `npm run server` and go to `http://localhost:8080`
